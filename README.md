# Audio captioning DCASE baseline system - 2020

Welcome to the repository of the audio captioning baseline system
for the DCASE challenge of 2020. 

Here you can find the complete code of the baseline system, consisting
of:  

  1. the caption evaluation part,
  2. the dataset pre-processing/feature extraction part,
  3. the data handling part for Pytorch library, and
  4. the deep neural network (DNN) method part
  
Parts 1, 2, and 3, also exist in separate repositories. Caption evaluation
tools for audio captioning can also be found
[here](https://github.com/audio-captioning/caption-evaluation-tools). 
Code for dataset pre-processing/feature extraction for Clotho dataset can
also be found [here](https://github.com/audio-captioning/clotho-dataloader).
Finally, code for handling the Clotho data (i.e. extracted features and 
one-hot encoded words) for PyTorch library (i.e. PyTorch DataLoader for
Clotho data) can also be found
[here](https://github.com/audio-captioning/clotho-dataloader).
